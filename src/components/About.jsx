                When I become an adult, I would like to be a genius, millionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Yes, like him.
                But just in case it doesn't happen, I armed myself with knowledge on front and back end, to develop amazing web
                applications. <br />
                I became a full stack web developer, graduated 
                from <a href="https://www.soyhenry.com/" target='_blank' className='text-yellow-500'>SoyHenry</a>,
                and studied at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target='_blank' className='text-violet-500'>Udemy</a>, 
                to later become self-taught. <br />
